1. Setup project that has been discussed in the class. Make sure you can run both tests (native and web) successfully.
Done! Both tests run successfully.
2. For existing native mobile autotest try to use another locator (xpath, classname, ?). Define these locators using
Appium Inspector. Are there any difference with id version?
The only difference between using both locator is the different search type.
3. Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?
deviceName in DriverSetup.class should be changed from emulator-5554 to phone serial number
('c21b9a8d7d94' in that case).
4. Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?
There is no difference (for example: equal time of test runs), but real device gives an opportunity for the
observability of all actions on the phone screen.
5. What should be improved/changed in existing test code? Why, for what?
—There should be no absolute paths, because this can cause errors when used on other computers.
—It is prohibited to use Thread.sleep().
—To make this code maintainability by every new programmer, it should have comments, descriptions and documents
as much as possible.
