1. Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?
—The singleton pattern garantees the creation and existence of only one driver and wait.
2. Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
—I suggest that one of improvements is to make liquidate the hardcoded values and
another one makes us to not initialize the biggest part of variables in driver.class.

—added
4. Optional: Add keyboard presence check  in “native” test.
—added
5. Which checks would you place in the “web” test?
—I placed there checks of presence web page's blocks and proper texts
6. Implement checks for “web” test in code and try to use.
